# Omniverse USD MCP Server Refactoring Summary

## Progress Report

We've successfully refactored the Omniverse USD MCP Server to implement a two-level architecture for better maintainability and performance. This architecture provides a clear separation between basic USD stage management and higher-level USD operations.

### Completed Work

#### Level A: Basic USD Operations
- ✅ Implemented a thread-safe `StageRegistry` class for centralized stage management
- ✅ Added unique stage IDs to identify and manage stages independent of file paths
- ✅ Implemented proper locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety
- ✅ Added stage lifecycle management with explicit open/close operations
- ✅ Created an LRU caching mechanism with automatic cleanup
- ✅ Implemented a registry maintenance thread for background cleanup

#### Level B: Advanced USD Operations
- ✅ Converted major USD operations to use the new stage ID-based API:
  - `analyze_stage_by_id`: Scene analysis and structure reporting
  - `create_mesh_by_id`: Mesh creation with vertex data
  - `create_primitive_by_id`: Simple primitive creation (spheres, cubes, etc.)
  - `create_reference_by_id`: USD referencing between files
  - `create_material_by_id`: Material creation with PBR properties
  - `bind_material_by_id`: Material binding to geometry
  - `set_transform_by_id`: Transformation operations
  - `visualize_scene_graph_by_id`: Scene visualization in multiple formats

#### Client Integration
- ✅ Updated `cursor_integration.py` to use the new stage ID-based API consistently
- ✅ Updated `cursor_example.py` to demonstrate the new API usage
- ✅ Created `STAGE_ID_API_EXAMPLES.md` with comprehensive examples

#### Documentation
- ✅ Added notice to README.md about the refactoring
- ✅ Created REFACTORING.md to document the architecture and its benefits
- ✅ Updated NEXT_STEPS.md with progress and remaining tasks
- ✅ Created LINTER_FIXES.md to document manual fixes needed

### Remaining Work

#### Level B Completion
- Physics-related functions (add_rigid_body_by_id, setup_physics_scene_by_id, etc.)
- Animation-related functions (create_animation_by_id, etc.)
- Other specialized USD operations (instancing, layering, etc.)

#### Client Integration Completion
- Update `claude_integration.py` and `chatgpt_integration.py` to use the new API

#### Testing and Validation
- Create integration tests for all stage ID-based operations
- Test with large USD stages to validate memory management
- Performance profiling and optimization

#### Documentation and Cleanup
- Final API documentation with usage examples
- Consider deprecating old API functions in favor of the new ones
- Migration guide for users of the old API

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Improved Memory Management**
   - Explicit control over stage lifecycle
   - Reduced redundant loading of stages
   - Automatic cleanup of unused stages

2. **Enhanced Thread Safety**
   - All stage operations are protected by thread-safe mechanisms
   - Reduced risk of race conditions in multi-threaded environments

3. **Better Code Organization**
   - Clear separation between basic and advanced operations
   - More modular and maintainable codebase
   - Easier to extend with new functionality

4. **Consistent API Design**
   - All operations follow a uniform pattern using stage IDs
   - Clear and consistent error handling
   - Improved diagnostics through registry reporting

5. **Performance Improvements**
   - Reduced I/O operations by reusing stages
   - More efficient caching strategy
   - Better resource handling for large USD scenes

## Next Steps

The immediate priorities are:

1. Complete the remaining Level B functions
2. Update all client integration examples
3. Implement a comprehensive test suite
4. Finalize documentation and migration guides

Once these are complete, we can consider additional enhancements like transaction support, undo/redo functionality, and distributed stage management.
