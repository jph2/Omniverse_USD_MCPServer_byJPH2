# Integrity Report for Omniverse USD MCP Server

## Overview

This report documents the integrity improvements made to the Omniverse USD MCP Server codebase as part of the refactoring to a two-level architecture with stage ID-based operations.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Stage ID-based API Completion

- **Physics Integration**: Added the previously missing physics-related functions:
  - `setup_physics_scene_by_id`: Creates and configures physics scenes with the new stage ID pattern
  - `add_rigid_body_by_id`: Adds rigid body properties to prims using the new stage ID pattern

- **Integration Testing**: Created a comprehensive `check_integrity.py` script that:
  - Verifies function signatures match between file path-based and stage ID-based versions
  - Ensures parameter types and defaults are consistent
  - Validates return types for all paired functions
  - Identifies any file path functions missing stage ID counterparts

### 2. Client Integration Improvements

- **Updated All Client Files**:
  - `cursor_integration.py`: Now fully utilizes the stage ID-based API
  - `cursor_example.py`: Demonstrates proper usage with the new `create_if_missing` parameter
  - `usd_mcp_client.py`: Added complete set of stage ID-based methods
  - `claude_integration.py`: Updated tool definitions for compatibility with stage ID API
  - `chatgpt_integration.py`: Updated function definitions to use stage ID-based operations

### 3. Documentation Enhancements

- **Comprehensive Documentation**:
  - `STAGE_ID_API_EXAMPLES.md`: Added examples of how to use the new stage ID-based API
  - `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`: Updated to reflect current progress and integrity check results
  - `NEXT_STEPS.md`: Revised with completed tasks and pending work

### 4. Progress on Linter Issues

While some linter issues remain to be resolved, we've made progress in identifying and documenting them. The main issues are:

- Indentation issues in the `create_stage` function
- Indentation issues in the `analyze_stage` function
- Try-except structure in the `get_usd_schema` function

## Current Integrity Status

The current integrity check confirms:

- All essential USD operations now have corresponding stage ID-based versions
- Parameter names, types, and defaults are consistent between paired functions
- Return types match between file path-based and stage ID-based functions

## Remaining Work

The following steps are needed to complete the integrity improvements:

1. **Animation Functions**: Implement stage ID versions of all animation-related functions
2. **Collision Functions**: Add stage ID versions of collision-related functions
3. **Joint Functions**: Add stage ID versions of joint-related functions
4. **Skeleton Functions**: Add stage ID versions of skeleton-related functions
5. **Fix Remaining Linter Issues**: Address indentation and code structure issues

## Conclusion

The refactoring has significantly improved the integrity of the codebase by ensuring consistent API patterns, proper error handling, and comprehensive documentation. The stage ID-based architecture provides a more maintainable and robust foundation for future development.
